# win32messagebox
A cross-platform Python package, compatible with tkinter's messagebox module, that provides an API for Windows-like messageboxes.

# Known issues (for non-Windows systems only):
* Messagebox has system-wide modality, it always appears on top of every other active window. This behaviour cannot be changed.
